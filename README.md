## Client Integration Solutions

### React Front-end has two dependancies

- [RESTful API server with datastore, and mongose](https://github.com/krymarie/Final-FullStack-API)

- [GraphQL API server with prisma and Docker](https://github.com/krymarie/GraphQL-API-Node-Server)

### To install and serve front-end

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

# Final Project Documentation

### Conditional logic and array methods render large lists

- [AllClients mapped into individual clients for seeding](https://github.com/krymarie/GraphQL-API-Node-Server/blob/master/prisma/seed.js#L11)
- [For loop of allClients seeds each client into the DB](https://github.com/krymarie/GraphQL-API-Node-Server/blob/master/prisma/seed.js#L26)
  )

### Front-end developed and function

- Front end was developed using <img src="https://rawgit.com/gorangajic/react-icons/master/react-icons.svg" width="15" alt="React Icon"> react and is responsive and has multiple nave items that populate data conditionally. run `npm install` and `npm start` after deploying other dependancies above.

### NPM scripts and Node used to create and manage back-end

- [npm scrips here used to generate and manage API and DB](https://github.com/krymarie/GraphQL-API-Node-Server/blob/master/package.json#L11)
- [nodemon script here used to serve up RESTful API](https://github.com/krymarie/Final-FullStack-API/blob/master/package.json#L8)

### Properly used Git with 4 days of commits per week

- [33 days of commits between February 19th thru April 27th](https://github.com/krymarie)

### Seed script populates datastore properly

- [Follow instructions on GraphQL API <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRvM8_0u5jqs7UY57Q-QgKtr6DCwIpXBLg1OvH2TFdghpyYqhdH&s" width="15" alt="React Icon">and you will see 25 clients added to the DB successfully](https://github.com/krymarie/GraphQL-API-Node-Server)

### RESTful server properly CREATES, READS, UPDATES, and DELETES

- [CREATES](https://github.com/krymarie/Final-FullStack-API/blob/master/controllers/feed.js#L19)
- [READS](https://github.com/krymarie/Final-FullStack-API/blob/master/controllers/feed.js#L1)
- [UPDATES]()
- [DELETES]()

### GraphQL server properly CREATES, READS, UPDATES, and DELETES

### App properly connects client and server using HTTP/HTTPS

- [Front-end connected via HTTP/HTTPS]()

### Detailed ReadMe provided which explains install and run instructions.

- You're looking at it :wink:

### App structured, documented, and deployed without errors.

- All three branches are documented and will deploy without any errors
